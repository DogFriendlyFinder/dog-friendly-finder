# FAQ Generation & Schema Implementation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented FAQ generation in Anthropic content pipeline and FAQPage schema.org structured data for SEO.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Anthropic Prompt Updates ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/app/api/restaurants/[id]/generate-content/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `faqs` field to OUTPUT FORMAT (lines 158-163)
- Added comprehensive FAQ generation rules section (lines 1514-1624)
- **Mandates dog-friendly question as FIRST FAQ** (always)
- Specifies exactly 5 FAQs per restaurant
- Provides complete examples and writing guidelines

**FAQ Requirements:**
1. **FAQ #1 (Mandatory):** Dog-friendly question
   - Format: "Are dogs allowed at [Restaurant Name]?"
   - Must cover: indoor/outdoor areas, restrictions, amenities (water bowls, dog menu)

2. **FAQs #2-5:** Choose from topics based on available data:
   - Cuisine type and dishes
   - Price range and value
   - Reservations and booking
   - Dress code
   - Parking
   - Opening hours
   - Location

**Writing Standards:**
- British English spelling throughout
- Restaurant name in every question (SEO optimization)
- 2-4 sentences per answer
- Factual, conversational tone
- No AI clich√©s

### 2. FAQPage Schema Component ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/lib/schema/global/faq.ts`

**Purpose:** Generates schema.org FAQPage structured data from restaurant FAQs

**Features:**
- Converts database FAQs to proper schema.org format
- Returns `undefined` if no FAQs (graceful handling)
- Includes proper `@id` with #faq anchor

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "@id": "https://www.dogfriendlyfinder.com/places-to-eat/restaurants/[slug]#faq",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Are dogs allowed at [Restaurant Name]?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Detailed factual answer..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Restaurant Schema Generator Updates ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/lib/schema/business/restaurant.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `faqs` to `RestaurantInput` interface
- Imported `generateFAQPageSchema` from global/faq.ts
- Modified return type to array: `Array<RestaurantSchema | FAQPageSchema>`
- Generates FAQPage schema if FAQs exist
- Returns array with both Restaurant and FAQPage schemas

**Return Structure:**
```typescript
// If FAQs exist:
[RestaurantSchema, FAQPageSchema]

// If no FAQs:
[RestaurantSchema]
```

### 4. Restaurant Page Integration ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/app/places-to-eat/restaurants/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `faqs: restaurant.faqs` to `generateRestaurantSchema` call
- Schema generator now returns array
- JsonLd component already handles arrays (no changes needed)

### 5. JsonLd Component (Already Compatible) ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/lib/schema/components/JsonLd.tsx`

**Status:** No changes needed - already accepts `object | object[]`

Properly renders:
- Single schema objects
- Arrays of schema objects (Restaurant + FAQPage)

## Testing Status

### Current State:
- ‚úÖ Restaurant schema renders successfully
- ‚úÖ Page loads without errors (HTTP 200)
- ‚úÖ FAQPage schema logic implemented
- ‚è≥ **England's Grace has no FAQs yet** (not generated)
- ‚úÖ System correctly omits FAQPage when FAQs don't exist

### Expected After FAQ Generation:
When you run `/api/restaurants/[id]/generate-content` for England's Grace:
1. Anthropic will generate 5 FAQs (first one about dogs)
2. FAQs will be stored in `restaurants.faqs` JSONB column
3. FAQPage schema will automatically appear in page source
4. validator.schema.org will validate both Restaurant + FAQPage

## How to Use

### Generate FAQs for a Restaurant:

```bash
# Call the content generation API
POST /api/restaurants/[id]/generate-content

# Anthropic will automatically:
# 1. Generate 5 SEO-optimized FAQs
# 2. First FAQ always about dog-friendliness
# 3. Store raw output in restaurants.anthropic_generated_content
# 4. Auto-populate live column: restaurants.faqs
# 5. Auto-populate ALL other columns (about, phone, hours, etc.)
# 6. FAQPage schema will auto-render on page immediately
```
